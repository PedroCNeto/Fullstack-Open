Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    Note right of browser: The browser loads the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON files from the HTTP GET

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa/?note
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Return the same page but now with the new note.
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The SPA (Single Page Application) can do that because the JavaScript can prevent the POST event and handle all the POST process behind the JS file and update only the new section, improving load time.


```
