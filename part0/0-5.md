Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML File
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: CSS File
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: JS File
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: We need the JavaScript file first to load and read the data from the JSON file

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: JSON File
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Now the browser can load from the JSON the info needed
    Note right of browser: All the process is very similiar to the other method, but now when we POST a new note the page can do all the logic behind the JS file


```
